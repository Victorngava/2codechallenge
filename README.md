## Introduction
Question 1
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

Question 2
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Question 3
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

## Description
1. Challenge 1:
     -Use the swapCase function to swap the case of each character in the given string.

2. Challenge 2:
    -Use the generateArray function to generate an array of numbers between the given two numbers.

3. Challenge 3:
    -Use the isPrime function to check if a number is prime and use the getPrimeNumbers function to filter the input array and return only the prime numbers.
